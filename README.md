# Hilo

This program is my creation of the game Hilo under the specified restrictions given. The player will try to guess whether the next card in the deck will be higher or lower than the current one. If the guess correctly they will recieve 100 point, if the guess is incorrect they lose 75. I used classes and objects to create a deck of cards that had both value and a shape. I used an online template to print the cards in the terminal to give a little bit more of a visual on what was going on and to make the game a bit more involved. 

I used python and Github to create this project, and also used online resources to learn how to make an image in the terminal.
